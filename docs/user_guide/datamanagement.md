# Data Management

A xcube viewer may hold several xcube datasets which you can select via the drop-down menu _Dataset_.
The viewed area automatically adjusts to a selected xcube dataset, meaning that if a newly selected
dataset is located in a different region, the correct region is displayed on the map.

_Variable_.
