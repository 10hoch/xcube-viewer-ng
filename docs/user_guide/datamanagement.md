# Data Management

## Select Dataset and Variables

A xcube viewer may hold several xcube datasets which you can select via the drop-down menu **Dataset**.
The viewed area automatically adjusts to a selected xcube dataset, meaning that if a newly selected
dataset is located in a different region, the correct region is displayed on the map.

If more than one variable is available within a selected xcube dataset, you may change the variable by using the drop-down menu
**Variable**.

## Integrate (User) Base Maps and Overlays

The Viewer gives the option to display the datasets in front of a Base Map and to overlay datasets with additional information (regarding e.g. transportation or place names). A large number of Base Maps and Overlay layers are already integrated in the viewer and additional ones can be added as well. Further instructions can be found [here](../user_guide/settings.md/#base-maps-and-overlays).
