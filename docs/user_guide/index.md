# User Guide

The xcube viewer functionality is described exemplary using the [xcube viewer demo](https://bc-viewer.brockmann-consult.de).
The viewer visualizes data from the xcube datasets on top of a basemap.

The interface of the viewer is grouped into different blocks with different tasks. These are the groups:

![Interface](../assets/images/interface.png)

1. Datamanagement (Select Datasets, Variables or Basemaps)
2. Analyse (create Time Series and Compare Variables)
3. Creating, managing Places for Statistics and Time Series
4. Select Dates from the Dataset or move through time with Player
5. Side bar (Metadata or diplay of Statistics or Time Series)
6. Color Mapping (change and create Colormapping)
7. Settings

For zooming use the buttons in the top right corner of the map window or the zooming function of your
computer mouse. A scale for the map is located in the lower right corner and in the
upper left corner a corresponding legend to the mapped data of the data cube is available.
