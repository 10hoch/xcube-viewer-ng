Besides the data variables, a dataset also provides metadata such as the spatio-temporal coverages, the type of coordinates, and information about the content. A dataset can be associated with places that are organised in place groups.</p> <p>Datasets that provide variables with two spatial dimensions and a time dimension are also referred to as data cubes. Hence, the data cubes supported by the viewer are 4-D: variable, time, y, and x. The viewer may support also other data cube dimensions in the future.</p> <p>The list of available datasets is usually fixed for a deployed viewer application instance. One of the datasets is the viewer's selected dataset.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/#variable","title":"Variable","text":"<p>A variable provides n-dimensional, gridded, geospatial data.
